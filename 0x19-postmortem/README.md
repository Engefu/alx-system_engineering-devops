Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: 15th January 2024, 09:00 AM - 12:30 PM 
Impact: The outage affected huthentication service, rendering user login and account access unavailable

Timeline:

09:00 AM: Issue detected through an increase in error rates observed in the monitoring system.
09:15 AM: Investigation began to identify the root cause, focusing on recent deployments and system logs.
10:00 AM: Initial assumption pointed towards a database connection issue.
11:00 AM: Misleading path: Database logs extensively examined, but no issues were found, delaying the identification of the true root cause.
11:30 AM: Incident escalated to senior engineers and system architects.
12:30 PM: The issue was resolved by identifying and correcting a misconfiguration in the authentication service code.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The outage was caused by an unintended configuration change in the authentication service, leading to a sudden surge in traffic that the system couldn't handle efficiently.
Resolution: The misconfiguration was identified by carefully reviewing recent code changes. A rollback to the previous version and implementing additional safeguards against similar issues were applied to restore normal service.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Code Review Process: Strengthen the code review process to catch configuration changes that might impact system behavior.
Automated Testing: Enhance automated testing to include checks for common misconfigurations that could lead to service disruptions.
Monitoring: Expand monitoring to include real-time traffic analysis and immediate alerts for unexpected spikes in user activity.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement Rollback Mechanism: Develop a robust rollback mechanism to quickly revert to the previous system state in case of unexpected issues.
Documentation Update: Enhance system documentation to include details about critical configuration parameters and their potential impact.
Training: Conduct training sessions for the development and operations teams to raise awareness about the potential risks associated with configuration changes.
Incident Response Plan Review: Review and update the incident response plan to include specific steps for handling configuration-related issues.
Communication Protocol: Establish a clear communication protocol for incidents, ensuring timely updates to internal teams and users in the event of service disruptions.
Conclusion:
This outage highlighted the critical importance of rigorous code review processes and thorough monitoring systems. By implementing the suggested corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our system against similar incidents in the future. We appreciate the patience and understanding of our users during the disruption and assure them that we are committed to continuously improving our services
